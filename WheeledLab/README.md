## Installing IsaacLab (~20 min)

Note: Only use this pip installation approach if you're on Ubuntu 22.04+ or Windows. For Ubuntu 20.04, install from the binaries. [link](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/index.html)

WheeledLab is built atop Isaac Lab. If you do not yet have Isaac Lab installed, it is open-source and installation instructions for Isaac Sim v4.5.0 and Isaac Lab v2.0.2 can be found below:

```bash
# Create a conda environment named WL and install Isaac Sim v4.5.0 in it:
conda create -n WL python=3.10
conda activate WL
pip install torch==2.5.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121 # Or `pip install torch==2.5.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118` for CUDA 11
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install 'isaacsim[all,extscache]==4.5.0' --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com

# Install Isaac Lab v2.0.2 (make sure you have build dependencies first, e.g. `sudo apt install cmake build-essential` on ubuntu)
git clone --branch v2.0.2 https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab.git
./isaaclab.sh -i
```

Source: https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/index.html

If you already have IsaacLab you can skip this and instead head [here](#create-new-isaaclab-conda-environment) to set up a new conda environment for this repository.

### Create New IsaacLab Conda Environment

We recommend setting up a new [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html) environment to include both `IsaacLab` packages and `WheeledLab` packages. You can do this using Isaac Lab's convenient setup scripts:

```bash
cd <IsaacLab>
./isaaclab.sh --conda WL
conda activate WL
./isaaclab.sh -i
```

## Installing WheeledLab (~5 min)

```bash
# Activate the conda environment that was created via the IsaacLab setup.
conda activate <your IsaacLab env here> # 'WL' if you followed instructions above

git clone git@github.com:UWRobotLearning/WheeledLab.git
cd WheeledLab/source
pip install -e wheeledlab
pip install -e wheeledlab_tasks
pip install -e wheeledlab_assets
pip install -e wheeledlab_rl
```

After this, we recommend [Setting Up VSCode](https://github.com/UWRobotLearning/WheeledLab?tab=readme-ov-file#training-quick-start).

## Training Quick Start

Training runs can take a couple hours to produce a transferable policy.

To start a drifting run:

```bash
python source/wheeledlab_rl/scripts/train_rl.py --headless -r RSS_DRIFT_CONFIG
```

To start a elevation run:

```bash
python source/wheeledlab_rl/scripts/train_rl.py --headless -r RSS_ELEV_CONFIG
```

To start a visual run:

```bash
python source/wheeledlab_rl/scripts/train_rl.py --headless -r RSS_VISUAL_CONFIG
```

Though optional (and free), we strongly advise using [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site/) (`wandb`) to record and track training status. Logging to `wandb` is turned on by default. If you would like to disable it, add `train.log.no_wandb=True` to the CLI arguments.

See more details about training in the `wheeledlab_rl` [README.md](source/wheeledlab_rl/docs/README.md)

## Deployment

A separate repository is maintained for existing integrations and deployments. See https://github.com/UWRobotLearning/RealLab for code.

### Current Integrations

1. HOUND [1] - https://github.com/UWRobotLearning/RealLab/tree/hound
2. MuSHR [2] - https://github.com/UWRobotLearning/RealLab/tree/mushr
3. F1Tenth [3] - (coming soon)

If you have an integration or request for a platform not seen above, please contact us or consider contributing!

## Setting Up VSCode

It is a million times harder to develop in IsaacLab without Intellisense. Setting up the vscode workspace is
STRONGLY advised.

0. Find where your `IsaacLab` directory currently is. We'll refer to it as `<IsaacLab>` in this section. Move the VSCode tools to this workspace.

   ```bash
   cd <WheeledLab>
   cp -r <IsaacLab>/.vscode/tools ./.vscode/
   cp -r <IsaacLab>/.vscode/*.json ./.vscode/
   ```

1. Change `.vscode/tasks.json` line 11

   ```json
   "command": "${workspaceFolder}/../IsaacLab/isaaclab.sh -p ${workspaceFolder}/.vscode/tools/setup_vscode.py"
   ```

   to

   ```json
   "command": "<IsaacLabDir>/isaaclab.sh -p ${workspaceFolder}/.vscode/tools/setup_vscode.py"
   ```

2. `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` to bring up the VSCode command palette. type `Tasks:Run Task` or type until you see it show up and highlight it and press `Enter`.
3. Click on `setup_python_env`. Follow the prompts until you're able to run the task. You should see a console at the bottom and the status of the task.
4. If successful, you should now have `.vscode/{settings.json, launch.json}` in your `<WheeledLab>` repo and `settings.json` should have a populated list of paths under the `"python.analysis.extraPaths"` key.
5. Make sure you at least have Microsoft's Python extension installed for intellisense to work. 

### If it still doesn't work

The `setup_vscode` task doesn't work for me for whatever reason. If that's true for you too, add the following lines to the end of the list under the key `"python.analysis.extraPaths"` in the `.vscode/settings.json` file:

```json
    "<IsaacLab>/source/isaaclab",
    "<IsaacLab>/source/isaaclab_assets",
    "<IsaacLab>/source/isaaclab_tasks",
    "<IsaacLab>/source/isaaclab_rl",
```
